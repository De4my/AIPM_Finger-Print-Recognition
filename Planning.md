### Risk Identification Chart
| Control Element | Issue | How and when will it likely go wrong? | Solution |
|:---:|----|-------|-----|
|Quality <br> (Poor attitude toward quality; substandard design, materials, workmanship; insufficient quality assurance program)|Insufficient Quality Assurance Program: The system might not comprehensively recognize a fingerprint or might mismatch a fingerprint because of physical displacement or distortion. Photocopy of the fingerprint might be scanned by the reader. |How: The fingerprint cannot be recognized and classified into patterns. <br> <br> When: The concern will be identified during the unit testing phase. | Purpose a new approach with a more enhanced recognition rate and matching technique. |
|Cost <br> (Estimating errors; inadequate productivity, cost, change, or contingency)|It is often expensive to scale the system that are entirely dependent on hardware as there will be a need to install hardware at every location and need for extra equipment, such as high-resolution cameras required for iris recognition and fingerprint readers for fingerprint recognition. The extra equipment makes the recognition expensive and difficult to scale. Also, there is no alternative to investing in new hardware every time. |How: The fingerprint recognition system will be needed to install in different locations where mostly employees working on remote sites or massive production floors. <br> <br> When: Concern rises at deployment stage where system needed to be installed in different locations. | Invest in cost-effective and affordable devices.
|Time <br> (Errors in estimating time or resource availability; errors in determining the critical path; poor allocation and management of float; early release of competitive products) | Failing to meet datelines of the tasks result in derailing project off the time track. Lack of proper resource allocation will result in not finding the right resources with the right skills that is important to finish the project within the estimated time. Failing to do so will also lead to derailing project plans off their tracks.Thus stakeholders will put pressure that will disrupt resource scheduling and weakens customer relationship and trust. |How: The team fail to accomplish a task to finish off the system around the estimated time.   <br> <br> When: Issue arises at development stage and becomes more concerned | Team leader keep up with the timeline track and communicate with the team about meeting timelines. Propose a proper and accurate resource management plan.
