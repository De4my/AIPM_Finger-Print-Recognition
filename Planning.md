### Risk Identification Chart
| Control Element | Issue | How and when will it likely go wrong? | Solution |
|:---:|----|-------|-----|
|Quality <br> (Poor attitude toward quality; substandard design, materials, workmanship; insufficient quality assurance program)|Insufficient Quality Assurance Program: The system might not comprehensively recognize a fingerprint or might mismatch a fingerprint because of physical displacement or distortion. Photocopy of the fingerprint might be scanned by the reader. |How: The fingerprint cannot be recognized and classified into patterns. <br> <br> When: The concern will be identified during the unit testing phase. | Purpose a new approach with a more enhanced recognition rate and matching technique. |
|Cost <br> (Estimating errors; inadequate productivity, cost, change, or contingency)|It is often expensive to scale the system that are entirely dependent on hardware and peripherals as there will be a need to install hardware at every location. There is no alternative to investing in new hardware every time. Low cost of fingerprint recognition technology may provide a barrier to expand the business. | 
|Time <br> (Errors in estimating time or resource availability; errors in determining the critical path; poor allocation and management of float; early release of competitive products) |
