### Risk Identification Chart
| Control Element | Issue | How and when will it likely go wrong? | Solution |
|:---:|----|-------|-----|
|Quality <br> (Poor attitude toward quality; substandard design, materials, workmanship; insufficient quality assurance program)|Insufficient Quality Assurance Program: The system might not comprehensively recognize a fingerprint or might mismatch a fingerprint because of physical displacement or distortion. Photocopy of the fingerprint might be scanned by the reader. |How: The fingerprint cannot be recognized and classified into patterns. <br> <br> When: The concern will be identified during the unit testing phase. | Purpose a new approach with a more enhanced recognition rate and matching technique. |
|Cost <br> (Estimating errors; inadequate productivity, cost, change, or contingency)|It is often expensive to scale a system that is entirely dependent on hardware as there will be a need to install hardware at every location and need for extra equipment, such as high-resolution cameras required for iris recognition and fingerprint readers for fingerprint recognition. The extra equipment makes the recognition expensive and difficult to scale. Also, there is no alternative to investing in new hardware every time. |How: The fingerprint recognition system will be needed to install in different locations where most employees work on remote sites or massive production floors. <br> <br> When: Concern rises at the deployment stage where the system needed to be installed in different locations. | Invest in cost-effective and affordable devices.
|Time <br> (Errors in estimating time or resource availability; errors in determining the critical path; poor allocation and management of float; early release of competitive products) | Failing to meet the datelines of the tasks results in derailing the project off the time track. Lack of proper resource allocation will result in not finding the right resources with the right skills that are important to finish the project within the estimated time. Failing to do so will also lead to derailing project plans off their tracks. Thus stakeholders will put pressure that will disrupt resource scheduling and weakens customer relationship and trust. |How: The team fail to accomplish a task to finish off the system around the estimated time.   <br> <br> When: Issue arises at the development stage and becomes more concerned. | Team leader keeps up with the timeline track and communicates with the team about meeting timelines. Propose a proper and accurate resource management plan. 

### Responsibility Assignment Matrices (RAM)
Responsibility Assignment Matrix (RAM), also known as a RACI chart or RACI matrix, is a technique used for assignment and visual display of responsibilities of each people or job in a task. RACI is a RAM that is used to depict the connections between work or activities and team members. This method will assign a task to each individual creating a visual matrix showing who is responsible for which task. By identifying the role of each individual it can avoid any unnecessary duplication of tasks and responsibilities, improve team communication, and increase the efficiency of the project completion.

- Responsible (R): The person(s) who will complete the task
- Accountable (A): The team member coordinating the actions, making decisions, and delegating to those responsible for each task, signing off on work that the Responsible completed. This ensures that they are completed precisely and on time, the timeliness of the project, and the fair division of tasks among the responsible people. 
- Consulted (C): The person(s) especially the expert who will carry out 2-way communication and analysis regarding decisions and opinions.
- Informed (I): The person(s) who will be kept up-to-date on progress during the project and upon completion of the task or deliverable
