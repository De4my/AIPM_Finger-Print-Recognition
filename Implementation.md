# Project Implementation
## Deliverables
### Hardware Requirement:
- Laptop
- Desktop

### Software Requirement:
- Python Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
- Database

### Intelligent System Architecture:
SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) Algorithm
Following are 5 steps involved in the SIFT algorithm.
1. Scale-space peak selection: Potential location for finding features.
2. Keypoint Localization: Accurately locating the feature keypoints.
3. Orientation Assignment: Assigning orientation to keypoints.
4. Keypoint descriptor: Describing the keypoints as a high dimensional vector.
5. Keypoint Matching
